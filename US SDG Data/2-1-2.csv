,,,,,"Food-insecure households had difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources. USDA's food insecurity statistics are similar in concept to those obtained with FAO's Food Insecurity Experience Scale. However, the threshold for food insecurity differs between the two data sources. FAO's measure of moderate or severe food insecurity is somewhat more severe than USDA's measure of food insecurity. Therefore, the prevalence of US food insecurity as measured by USDA is higher than the prevalence of US food insecurity as measured by FAO's Food Insecurity Experience Scale. FAO measures moderate or severe food insecurity among adults while USDA measures food insecurity among US households."
